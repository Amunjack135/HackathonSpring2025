            You are building an AI-powered system for Chevron to assess employee capabilities and match them to the most suitable internal roles.
    
            The system will:
            - AnalyzÃ¥e employee data such as performance reviews, project outcomes, self-assessments, and peer feedback.
            - Extract relevant technical and soft skills.
            - Compare these skills with Chevron's available roles to determine the best match.
    
            Given the following resume or employee data, do the following:
    
            1. Extract **exactly 8** key skills (technical , certifications, or tools).
    
            Chevron Roles:
            - Cloud Engineer
            - Network Engineer
            - Infrastructure Engineer
            - Data Engineer
            - Data Analyst
