PROJECTS
[Generative Adversarial Networks for Evaluating Genetic and Protein Sequences], [Python, TensorFlow]
• Utilized GANs to generate artificial genetic and protein sequences with similarities to real-world natural sequences, focusing on G Protein-
Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) as training data.
• Implemented a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) to assess the degree of similarity between the generated sequences and natural
sequences using the E-value metric.
• Successfully generated sequences matching a specific GPCR protein, CXCR4, and observed hits in BLAST searches for membrane protein
varieties, indicating GAN's capability to produce similar sequences.
[Keep Up Web App], [Python, Flask, OpenAI API]
• Developed a web application tailored for cognitive-impaired users, leveraging OpenAI’s ChatGPT to analyze user input and emails,
generating personalized task schedules and time management goals.
• Integrated an AI chatbot to extract events from user input and emails, simplifying task management and time tracking.
